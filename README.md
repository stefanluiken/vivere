## Motivation

This project has been created to address a gap in the real estate online ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites, but often requires the user to pay for respective themes. 

Project Vivere seeks to address this, and provides the user with a fullstack ready-to-use open source codebase.

## Stack

- Python (3.8)
- Django (3.1)
- PostgreSQL (12)
- Bootstrap (4)
